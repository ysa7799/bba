Engineering-facing log of what landed per phase. Newest first.

## Phase 2 — Database + tenancy (2026-10-05)

- Schema: `users`, `organizations`, `memberships`, `organization_settings` with check
  constraints, explicit FK delete rules, and RLS policies (forced) on every table.
- `withTenant` / `withUser` / `withSystem` scoped transactions with branded types.
- `@businessos/organizations`: create organization (unique slug allocation, owner membership,
  extension hooks), list user organizations, resolve membership (404 semantics), update
  organization (allow-listed fields), list members (keyset pagination + search), typed settings.
- `@businessos/testing`: two-tenant world fixture; shared Vitest global setup.
- Fixed an RLS leak found by the new isolation suite (migration 0003).

## Phase 1 — Monorepo foundation (2026-10-05)

- Replaced the Express sample with a pnpm/Turborepo monorepo: `apps/{web,api,worker}`,
  `packages/{config,shared,database}`.
- Fastify API foundation (env validation, logging with redaction, request ids, helmet, CORS,
  rate limiting, error envelope, health endpoints), BullMQ worker bootstrap, Next.js skeleton.
- Money/ID/pagination primitives with tests; RLS helper functions migration.
